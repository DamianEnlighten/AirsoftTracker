Phase 1

App idea, Airsoft minimap, using phones location apis and google maps to plot users on map, IDs float over pins or just names on map, password to connect users like darksouls, also allow for custom maps
likely would have to update on a timer to save on battery and bandwidth but it could be either
basic idea would be to give situational awareness but could make it configurable if people want it faster

basic steps are 
1. send location to DB
2. plot current pin and center view on pin on map
3. get other users pins back with same password from DB
4. plot pins within view and their IDs
repeat ad infinitum

Users don't need a login as we can just use their device IDs as unique identifiers
but maybe add "accounts" later for marketing and retention purposes
alongside history

Phase 1.
client-
map, user pin, 
group pins, 
options page to set update interval,

lock to north or rotate map on rotate device

polling vs server push?

Server-
location in DB stored by device ID
clear out unused ID's after 12 hours of inactivity
MySQL DB for ease of use
setup a simple node/express server
RESTful API
