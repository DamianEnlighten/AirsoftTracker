Phase 1

App idea, Airsoft minimap, using phones location apis and google maps to plot users on map, IDs float over pins or just names on map, password to connect users like darksouls
likely would have to update on a timer to save on battery and bandwidth but it could be either

basic steps are 
1. send location to DB
2. plot current pin and center view on pin on map
3. get other users pins back with same password from DB
4. plot pins within view and their IDs
5. resize view area
repeat ad infinitum

Users don't need a login as we can just use their device IDs as unique identifiers
but maybe add "accounts" later for marketing and retention purposes
alongside history
