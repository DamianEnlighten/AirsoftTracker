Phase 1

App idea, Airsoft minimap, using phones location apis and google maps to plot users on map, IDs float over pins or just names on map, password to connect users like darksouls
likely would have to update on a timer to save on battery and bandwidth but it could be either

basic steps are 
1. send location to DB -X
2. plot current pin and center view on pin on map -X
3. get other users pins back with same password from DB -X
4. plot pins within view and their IDs
5. resize view area?
repeat ad infinitum

Phase 1.
client-
custom pin for user
map, user pin, -X
group pins, 
options page to set update interval, -X
Time stamp on pin info window.


Server-
location in DB stored by device ID
clear out unused ID's after 12 hours of inactivity
MySQL DB for ease of use
setup a simple node/express server
RESTful API


Phase 2

Groups/squads-colors, squad names?
Admin of multiple groups
logins
Allow input for spotted enemies with different pin (Disappears on timer)
button to log deaths.
Heat maps of deaths.
